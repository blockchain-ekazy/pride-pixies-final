                    Blockchain is the internet evolved, it is a network system
                    that verifies, authenticates and records all cryptocurrency
                    transactions. It’s an ecosystem that everything that we’ve
                    mentioned above lives on.You might hear blockchain referred
                    to as a distributed, public ledger. <br />
                    A public blockchain is similar to a database, but is
                    differentiated by a few key attributes. Decentralized: No
                    third party controls the record and there is no master copy.
                    Syncronized copies of the blockchain are distributed and
                    stored on computers around the world.
                    <br />
                    Public: Anyone who wants to can access the blockchain.
                    Public keys of wallets and their transactions are made
                    visable so that any user can confirm that transactions
                    legitimate. Immutable: once a transaction has been entered
                    into the record (a.ka ledger) changing it or erasing it is
                    infeasable ( and nearly impossible)

                    Polygon, formerly known as the MATIC Network, is a scaling
                    layer 2 solution built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain
                    that aims to make transactions simpler, faster and easier.
                    Polygon reduces network congestion and gas fees while making
                    individual transactions faster and more efficient. In a
                    nutshell, Polygon promises an effecient framework for
                    building interconnected networks and will help Ethereum
                    expand in size, security, efficiency and usefullness.
